            <h3>We are an organization at MITAOE Pune that provides students with the resources to develop robots.</h3>

            <h4>Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots.</h4>
            <br />
            <p>The concept and creation of autonomously operating machines dates back a long time, but credible research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. And today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as we continue to research, design and build new robots that serve various practical purposes including domestic, commercial and military. Having said that, the Robotics Club of IIT Delhi strives to stimulate interest in robotics among the students of the institute. Besides making a serious endeavour to spread knowledge on Robotics and its diverse applications, it also stands by the subtle acronym of TEAM - 'Together Everyone Achieves More'. It is this exemplary virtue that has bound the club and helped it to grow to its present potential. It was initiated way back in 2002 under the tutelage of Prof. S.K.Saha (Department of Mechanical Engineering), with the solitary objective of participating in the ROBOCON competition. But over the years it has diversified. We firmly believe in working in a planned, organized and disciplined manner that helps us in risk free management. The proceedings of the clubs are all pre-planned and run smoothly according to the constitution. Well defined goals, an organized and disciplined work structure and motivated members are the features of the club, to mention a few, that have helped the club to grow to a level where we see it now. The club today is an active platform for students to display and develop their practical machine building skills and knowledge. Any company interested to adopt any of the Robotics devices, we would be more than happy to adopt or transfer the technology.</p>
